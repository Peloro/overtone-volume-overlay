## Tips & Tricks

### Workflow Optimization
- **Quick Access**: Keep the overlay on a secondary monitor for always-visible controls
- **Profile Switching**: Create profiles for different scenarios (e.g., "Work", "Gaming", "Streaming")
- **Filter Shortcuts**: Use the filter to quickly find applications when you have many running
- **Resize for Density**: Make the window taller to see more apps at once, or shorter for a compact view

### Customization Ideas
- **Theme Matching**: Customize colors to match your desktop theme or favorite color scheme
- **Minimal Setup**: Hide the system volume control if you only need per-app controls
- **Always-Visible Filter**: Enable "Always show filter" if you frequently search for apps
- **Opacity Tweaks**: Lower opacity for a subtle overlay that doesn't obstruct your view

### Hotkey Suggestions
- Keep default hotkeys or customize to avoid conflicts with other applications
- Use memorable combinations like `Ctrl+Alt+V` for volume overlay
- Set quick access to settings for frequent adjustments

### Troubleshooting
- **Hotkeys Not Working**: Ensure the application is running with administrator privileges
- **Apps Not Showing**: Some system apps may not expose audio sessions - this is normal
- **Performance**: If you have many audio apps, use the filter to reduce visible items
- **Color Changes Not Applying**: Try switching profiles or restarting the overlay

- Debounced filter search (configurable) for smooth typing
- Coarse timer for application refresh (500ms)
- Batch UI updates with setUpdatesEnabled for smoother rendering
- Session diffing to avoid unnecessary UI updates
- Efficient memory cleanup with proper widget deletion

**Profile System:**
- JSON-based profile storage in `profiles.json`
- Active profile tracking
- Default profile protection (cannot be deleted/renamed)
- Profile switching with automatic settings reload
- Unsaved changes tracking with visual indicator

**Color Customization:**
- Dynamic stylesheet generation based on user colors
- RGBA and hex color support
- Real-time color preview in settings
- Cascading style updates across all components

**Hotkey Management:**
- Validation of hotkey format before registration
- Proper cleanup of keyboard hooks on exit

- Support for modifier keys (ctrl, shift, alt, win) and special keys

### Dependencies

- **PyQt5** (5.15+) - Modern GUI framework with extensive widget library
- **pycaw** - Windows Core Audio API wrapper for audio control
- **keyboard** - Global hotkey registration and handling
- **comtypes** - COM interface support for Windows APIs

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved and managed through two JSON files:

### `settings.json`
Contains the current active settings (deprecated, now uses profiles):
- Window dimensions (width, height)
- Opacity level
- Color theme customizations
- Behavioral settings
- Custom hotkey bindings

### `profiles.json`
Contains all saved profiles:
```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "Default": { /* default settings */ },
    "Work": { /* work profile settings */ },
    "Gaming": { /* gaming profile settings */ }
  },
  "active_profile": "Default"
}
```

Both files are automatically created with defaults if not found. Changes are saved with debouncing (500ms) to reduce disk I/O, except for explicit user actions which save immediately.

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Why does the application need administrator privileges?**  
A: Administrator privileges are required for global hotkey registration on Windows. Without them, hotkeys won't work outside the application window.

**Q: Can I use Overtone on multiple monitors?**  
A: Yes! The overlay can be dragged to any position on any monitor and will remember its location.

**Q: Does Overtone work with all applications?**  
A: Overtone works with any application that uses the Windows audio session API. Some system applications may not expose their audio sessions.

**Q: Will my settings be saved when I close the application?**  
A: Yes, all settings are automatically saved to `profiles.json`. The current profile's settings persist across sessions.

### Profiles

**Q: What's the difference between profiles and settings?**  
A: Profiles allow you to save complete sets of settings and switch between them instantly. You can have different profiles for work, gaming, or any other use case.

**Q: Can I delete the Default profile?**  
A: No, the Default profile is protected and cannot be deleted or renamed. It serves as a fallback and reference.

**Q: What happens to unsaved changes when I switch profiles?**  
A: Changes are marked with an asterisk (*) in the Profiles tab. You can save them to the current profile or switch without saving to discard changes.

### Customization

**Q: Can I change the color scheme?**  
A: Yes! The Colors tab in settings allows you to customize every color in the interface, including backgrounds, sliders, buttons, and text.

**Q: How do I reset colors to default?**  
A: In the Colors tab, click the "Reset Colors to Default" button at the bottom.

**Q: Can I hide the system volume control?**  
A: Yes, in Settings ‚Üí Settings tab, uncheck "Show system volume control in overlay".

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The overlay isn't showing when I press the hotkey**  
A: Ensure the application is running (check system tray). Also verify your hotkey isn't conflicting with another application.

**Q: Some applications aren't showing in the list**  
A: Only applications actively playing or capable of playing audio appear in the list. Some system apps may not expose audio sessions.

**Q: The application crashes on startup**  
A: Check the `overtone.log` file in the application directory for error details. You may need to delete `settings.json` and `profiles.json` to reset to defaults.

**Q: Hotkeys stopped working after changing them**  
A: Ensure your hotkey format is correct (e.g., `ctrl+shift+v`). Invalid formats will prevent registration. Check the log file for validation errors.
